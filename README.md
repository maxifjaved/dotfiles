Personal productivity configuration for macOS using Karabiner-Elements and Hammerspoon.

## Current Features

### Karabiner-Elements
- **Caps Lock → Hyper Key** (`⌘⌃⌥⇧`) + Escape when pressed alone
- **Right Command → F18** for modal app switching
- **Comprehensive Vim movements** with Hyper key (hjkl, word navigation, line operations)

### Hammerspoon
- **Enhanced window cycling** with anti-ping-pong logic
- **F18 modal system** for app switching (F18+W for WezTerm, F18+A for Arc, etc.)
- **Smart state management** prevents rapid cycling between same windows

## Future Enhancements

- [ ] `sig` → email signature
- [ ] `addr` → address
- [ ] `phone` → phone number
- [ ] `lorem` → Lorem ipsum text
- [ ] `shrug` → ¯\_(ツ)_/¯

### Missing Hotkeys (Karabiner)
- [ ] **Hyper + Space** → Spotlight search
- [ ] **Hyper + Return** → New terminal window
